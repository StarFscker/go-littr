# Issues
* When adding a new OAuth2 client from the command line, 
we shouldn't allow password flow by default, but based on a parameter.
* After submitting a Like/Dislike, it seems we can't Undo or do the reverse of it.
* All children objects should be added to the OP's replies collection.
* ~~A logged in user seems to be able to be allowed to edit/delete Anonymous objects.~~
* ~~A logged in user doesn't seem to be able to edit/delete his own objects.~~
