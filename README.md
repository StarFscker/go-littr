This is a new attempt at the social news aggregator paradigm.

It's based on the ActivityPub web specification and as such tries to leverage federation to prevent some 
of the pitfalls found in similar existing communities.

The main reason why aggregator networks lose their relevancy is the ever increasing number of users, 
which more often than not, to not subscribe to the existing group's interests and philosophy. As they grow, the 
topics start to wander over a large spectrum and people get flooded with irrelevant content. 
From the old member's perspective it's the "eternal September" effect. 

This is why the main component which will be missing here is the concept of using the same instance for 
merging multiple interest groups. As this concept disappears, being replaced by the instance itself 
every community will be able to create their own and enforce (or not) personal moderation and preferences.

This, I believe, will ensure a tighter focus and more freedom for the members of the community. 

At the same time, through the ActivityPub federation, the users can subscribe to other instances' stream
and will receive updates from them.
